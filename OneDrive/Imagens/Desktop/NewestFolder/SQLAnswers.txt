1.) 
The Length_in_sec field contains data pertaining to phone call durations made by calling agents (presumably out of a call center of sorts). 
The data type, smallint, can hold integer values within the range -32,768 to 32,767. 

Considering that the unit of measurement for this field is seconds, specifically, the amount of seconds that a phonecall is running for - it's safe to assume that hitting the smallint limit will be quite unlikely as 32,767 seconds translates to just over 9 hours, which is an incredibly long amount of time for 1 phone call to take place between a calling agent and a client.
